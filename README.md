# remove-HyperSwitch-expired-dialog

[HyperSwitch](https://bahoom.com/hyperswitch) is a free Window Switcher App on macOS. I used it a few years ago and haven't found a perfect replacement yet. But the author stopped updating the software a few years ago.

Currently the app always pops up with the error "HyperSwitch Expired!" Dialog box, and cannot turn off the auto-check for updates option, you can change the popover by replacing the executable file masking in this repo.
